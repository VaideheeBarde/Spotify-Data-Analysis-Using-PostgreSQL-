# Spotify-Data-Analysis-Using-PostgreSQL

**Overview** <br />
This project analyzes Spotify's database using PostgreSQL. It includes SQL queries that answer 13 analytical questions, categorized into Easy, Medium, and Advanced levels. The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and imported into PostgreSQL for querying.

**Technologies Used** <br />
PostgreSQL for database management and querying <br />
Kaggle as the data source <br />
SQL for data analysis <br />

**Dataset** <br />
The dataset contains details about tracks, albums, artists, and streaming statistics. <br />
This is where you can download the dataset - [Download the dataset here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sanjanchaudhari/spotify-dataset) <br />

**SQL Queries** <br />
**Easy Level** <br />
1. Retrieve the names of all tracks that have more than 1 billion streams.
2. List all albums along with their respective artists.
3. Get the total number of comments for tracks where licensed = TRUE.
4. Find all tracks that belong to the album type single.
5. Count the total number of tracks by each artist.

**Medium Level**
1. Calculate the average danceability of tracks in each album.
2. Find the top 5 tracks with the highest energy values.
3. List all tracks along with their views and likes where official_video = TRUE.
4. For each album, calculate the total views of all associated tracks.
5. Retrieve the track names that have been streamed on Spotify more than YouTube.

**Advanced Level**
1. Find the top 3 most-viewed tracks for each artist using window functions.
2. Write a query to find tracks where the liveness score is above the average.
3. Use a WITH clause to calculate the difference between the highest and lowest energy values for tracks in each album.

**How to Use** <br />
1. Clone this repository:
2. Import the dataset into PostgreSQL.
3. Run the SQL queries using a PostgreSQL client.
